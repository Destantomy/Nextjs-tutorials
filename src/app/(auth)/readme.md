In Next.js when we were used App Router as development method, then the folder used as the router. There's a condition when we want not to a folder use as router instead it's segment, then we can add () in it's name. Ex: to access login the url routes should be host/auth/login. We wont the 'auth' as router then we change the name as (auth).
